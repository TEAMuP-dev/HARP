Implementation of the ARA Playback Renderer. This class serves samples back to the DAW for playback, and handles mixing across tracks. We use this class to serve samples that have been processed from a deeplearning model. When the host requests samples, we view which playback region the playhead is located on, retrive the audio modification for that playback region, and read the samples from the audio modifications modified/processed audio buffered. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
