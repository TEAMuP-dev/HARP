The Processor Editor is the main interaction from users into the plugin. We utilize the Processor Editor to manage the UI of the plugin and control all user input. The Processor Editor manages the UI components for user input, and manages a callback to send UI information to the deeplearning model. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
