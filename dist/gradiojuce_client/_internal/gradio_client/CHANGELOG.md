## 0.6.0

### Highlights

#### new `FileExplorer` component ([#5672](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5672) [`e4a307ed6`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/e4a307ed6cde3bbdf4ff2f17655739addeec941e))

Thanks to a new capability that allows components to communicate directly with the server _without_ passing data via the value, we have created a new `FileExplorer` component.

This component allows you to populate the explorer by passing a glob, but only provides the selected file(s) in your prediction function. 

Users can then navigate the virtual filesystem and select files which will be accessible in your predict function. This component will allow developers to build more complex spaces, with more flexible input options.

## 0.5.0

### Highlights

#### Enable streaming audio in python client ([#5248](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5248) [`390624d8`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/390624d8ad2b1308a5bf8384435fd0db98d8e29e))

The `gradio_client` now supports streaming file outputs üåä

No new syntax! Connect to a gradio demo that supports streaming file outputs and call `predict` or `submit` as you normally would.

```python
import gradio_client as grc
client = grc.Client("gradio/stream_audio_out")

# Get the entire generated audio as a local file
client.predict("/Users/freddy/Pictures/bark_demo.mp4", api_name="/predict")

job = client.submit("/Users/freddy/Pictures/bark_demo.mp4", api_name="/predict")

# Get the entire generated audio as a local file
job.result()

# Each individual chunk
job.outputs()
```

 Thanks [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton)!

### Fixes

- [#5295](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5295) [`7b8fa8aa`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/7b8fa8aa58f95f5046b9add64b40368bd3f1b700) - Allow caching examples with streamed output.  Thanks [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94)!

## 0.4.0

### Highlights

#### Client.predict will now return the final output for streaming endpoints ([#5057](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5057) [`35856f8b`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/35856f8b54548cae7bd3b8d6a4de69e1748283b2))

### This is a breaking change (for gradio_client only)!

Previously, `Client.predict` would only return the first output of an endpoint that streamed results. This was causing confusion for developers that wanted to call these streaming demos via the client.

We realize that developers using the client don't know the internals of whether a demo streams or not, so we're changing the behavior of predict to match developer expectations.

Using `Client.predict` will now return the final output of a streaming endpoint. This will make it even easier to use gradio apps via the client.

## 0.3.0

### Highlights

#### Create Discord Bots from Gradio Apps ü§ñ ([#4960](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4960) [`46e4ef67`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/46e4ef67d287dd68a91473b73172b29cbad064bc))

We're excited to announce that Gradio can now automatically create a discord bot from any `gr.ChatInterface` app.

It's as easy as importing `gradio_client`, connecting to the app, and calling `deploy_discord`!

_ü¶ô Turning Llama 2 70b into a discord bot ü¶ô_

```python
import gradio_client as grc
grc.Client("ysharma/Explore_llamav2_with_TGI").deploy_discord(to_id="llama2-70b-discord-bot")
```

<img src="https://gradio-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/demo-files/discordbots/guide/llama_chat.gif">

#### Getting started with template spaces

To help get you started, we have created an organization on Hugging Face called [gradio-discord-bots](https://huggingface.co/gradio-discord-bots) with template spaces you can use to turn state of the art LLMs powered by Gradio to discord bots.

Currently we have template spaces for:

- [Llama-2-70b-chat-hf](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio-discord-bots/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf) powered by a FREE Hugging Face Inference Endpoint!
- [Llama-2-13b-chat-hf](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio-discord-bots/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf) powered by Hugging Face Inference Endpoints.
- [Llama-2-13b-chat-hf](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio-discord-bots/llama-2-13b-chat-transformers) powered by Hugging Face transformers.
- [falcon-7b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio-discord-bots/falcon-7b-instruct) powered by Hugging Face Inference Endpoints.
- [gpt-3.5-turbo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio-discord-bots/gpt-35-turbo), powered by openai. Requires an OpenAI key.

But once again, you can deploy ANY `gr.ChatInterface` app exposed on the internet! So don't hesitate to try it on your own Chatbots.

‚ùóÔ∏è Additional Note ‚ùóÔ∏è: Technically, any gradio app that exposes an api route that takes in a single string and outputs a single string can be deployed to discord. But `gr.ChatInterface` apps naturally lend themselves to discord's chat functionality so we suggest you start with those.

Thanks [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton)!

### New Features:

- Endpoints that return layout components are now properly handled in the `submit` and `view_api` methods. Output layout components are not returned by the API but all other components are (excluding `gr.State`).

# 0.1.2

First public release of the Gradio Client library! The `gradio_client` Python library that makes it very easy to use any Gradio app as an API.

As an example, consider this [Hugging Face Space that transcribes audio files](https://huggingface.co/spaces/abidlabs/whisper) that are recorded from the microphone.

![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/gradio-guides/whisper-screenshot.jpg)

Using the `gradio_client` library, we can easily use the Gradio as an API to transcribe audio files programmatically.

Here's the entire code to do it:

```python
from gradio_client import Client

client = Client("abidlabs/whisper")
client.predict("audio_sample.wav")

>> "This is a test of the whisper speech recognition model."
```

Read more about how to use the `gradio_client` library here: https://gradio.app/getting-started-with-the-python-client/
