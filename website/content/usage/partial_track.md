# Processing a Portion of a Region

HARP processes full regions in the DAW. Therefore, to edit a portion of an audio or MIDI region:

- Split the region to obtain the excerpt you want to edit as a separate region
- (Optional) Create a duplicate / bounce / alternate take of the region you want to edit
- Open with HARP to process
