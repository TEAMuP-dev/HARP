# Important Warnings

**HARP is a _destructive_ file editor.** When operating HARP as a standalone application, use _Save As_ to avoid overwriting input files. If you save your outputs while operating in the DAW, HARP will overwrite input regions. By creating a duplicate / bounce / alternate take of the region you want to edit with HARP, you can ensure the original region remains unaffected.
