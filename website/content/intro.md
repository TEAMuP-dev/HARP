# Welcome to HARP

HARP is a sample editor for **h**osted, **a**synchronous, **r**emote **p**rocessing of audio with machine learning. HARP operates as a standalone application or a plugin-like editor within your DAW, and routes audio, MIDI, and metadata through [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app) endpoints for processing. Gradio apps can be hosted locally or remotely (e.g., [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)), allowing DAW users (_e.g._ [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm), [Logic Pro X](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/), [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/)) to access powerful cloud-based models seamlessly from within their DAW.

To learn how to install, use, or contribute to HARP, see the linked documentation in the left sidebar. For a formal introduction to HARP, see our [NeurIPS paper](https://neuripscreativityworkshop.github.io/2023/papers/ml4cd2023_paper23.pdf) and our [ISMIR abstract](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02977).
