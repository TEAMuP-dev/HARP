# Welcome to HARP

[![HARP Repo](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=TEAMuP-dev&repo=HARP)](https://github.com/TEAMuP-dev/HARP)

HARP is a sample editor for **h**osted, **a**synchronous, **r**emote **p**rocessing of audio with machine learning. HARP operates as a standalone application or a plugin-like editor within your DAW, and routes audio, MIDI, and metadata through [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app) endpoints for processing. Gradio apps can be hosted locally or remotely (_e.g._, [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)), allowing users of DAWs (_e.g._ [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm), [Logic Pro X](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/), [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/)) to access powerful cloud-based models seamlessly from within their DAW.
