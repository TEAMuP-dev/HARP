# Contributing to HARP

HARP is part of a collaborative research project funded by [NSF Award 2222129](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2222129). All code is open source, and we welcome collaboration from the community to help bring cutting-edge deep learning research into the hands of creators. We monitor issues and pull requests on both the [HARP](https://github.com/TEAMuP-dev/HARP) and [PyHARP](https://github.com/TEAMuP-dev/pyharp) GitHub repositories.


To get started building and deploying models for others to use in HARP, see our [PyHARP documentation](/content/pyharp_docs/overview.html). To get started developing the HARP app itself, see our instructions on [building HARP](/content/contributing/build_source.html).
