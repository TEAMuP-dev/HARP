This folder needs to remain empty. During deployment of the website, 
all the markdown files in the HARP repository will be copied here,
so that they can be served by the website.

When you build the website locally, the markdown files will be copied here.
Even if you accidentally commit them, they will be replaced during building of the website,
so it is not a problem.

This is so we only need to manage the markdown files in one place, and can forget about the website,
and be sure it 'll always point to the latest version of the documentation.

The command that copies the MD files is in package.json.
Check website/.vitepress/config.mjs to see how the MD files can be used.
