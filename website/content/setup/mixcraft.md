# Set Up HARP in Acoustica Mixcraft

We recommend following Acoustica's [official instructions](https://acoustica.com/mixcraft-10-manual/audio-clips) on how to link external sample editors such as HARP into Mixcraft. Simply provide the path to your installed HARP executable (_e.g._ `HARP.app`).


### Open Audio with HARP in Mixcraft

To load an audio region into HARP without leaving the DAW, we can now do the following:

* Right-click a region, select _Edit In External Editor..._, choose _Edit A Copy_, and click _Edit_. HARP will perform __destructive__ edits if you save your outputs, meaning it will overwrite input regions. By selecting a copy, we ensure the original region is not affected.

* After editing, close HARP and click _Done_ to update the track.

For more instructions on how to use HARP, see our [Workflow](/content/usage/workflow.html) documentation.
