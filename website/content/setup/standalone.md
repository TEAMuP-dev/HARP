# Set Up HARP as a Standalone Application

After following the installation instructions for your operating system version, you can open HARP as a standalone application to start processing audio, MIDI, and metadata.

- **MacOS:** Launch HARP (`HARP.app`) from your `Applications` folder.
- **Windows:** Launch HARP (`HARP.exe`) from your chosen installation directory.
- **Linux:** Launch HARP (`HARP`) from your chosen installation directory.

Upon launching, you should see an "empty" HARP window that looks like this:

  <!-- TODO - Update screenshot -->

     <img width="528" src="/content/images/harp_empty.png">
  </p>

You're now ready to start using HARP! For a more streamlined experience, we recommend setting up HARP as an _external sample editor_ that can be accessed from within your DAW akin to a plugin. In the following pages, we provide instructions for linking HARP to popular DAWs.
